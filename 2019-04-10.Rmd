## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(stringr)

```










#str_subset:挑出一部分(selection with special conditions=>character vectors, patterns to look for)

#str_detect:detecting patterns
```{r}
course <- c("個體經濟學","投資學","總體經濟學")
str_subset(course,"經濟學")
str_detect(course,"經濟學")
```
#str_sub:extract and replace substrings from a character vector, the numbers means the start and end character of each element i a string vector you want to extract
```{r}
studentID<-c('410177115','410176080','410174233','410177011','410182045','410176014')

系別 <- str_sub(studentID,5,6)
入學年 <- str_sub(studentID,2,4)
系別
入學年
```

#join:str_c(): 多個字串向量的合併
```{r}
month <- c("3","4","2")
day <- c("11","5","7")

char1 <- c("月","月","月")
char2 <- c("日","日","日")
month
char1
day 
char2
str_c(month,char1,day,char2)
```
#the character vecyors can be different length, it will simply repeat the shorter vector
```{r}
str_c(month,c("月"),day,c("日"))#you can create a vecor that is not pre-estabalished in str_c

str_c(month,"月",day,"日")#you can be even more simpler by discarding C()
```
#you can use sep='' to seperate joined vectors apart
```{r}
month
day
str_c(month,day, sep="-")
```

#str_split(): 分割一個字串向量, ''裡的東西作為切割準則
```{r}
dates <- c("3-11", "4-5",  "2-7")
str_split(dates,"-")
```

#replace
```{r}
dates
str_replace(dates,"-","月")
```
