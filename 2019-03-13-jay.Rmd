## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#practice 1:Create an object with values

```{r}
a <- 2
3 -> b

65 + b

c <- 47
65 + c
```

#practice 2: if you want to know the value of an object, type it out within a -> ``
```{r}
`c`
```

#practice 3: if you want to name an object a complex name, use-> ``
```{r}
`107上學期我的平均成績` <- 100
```

#practice 4: class of an object 
```{r}
class(a)

a<-5 #this will override the previous value assigned to `a` 
a2<-5L #L means the value is an integer(the defalt class is float)


class(a)
class(a2)


aVector<-c(5,6,7) #c() means a vector
a2Vector<-c(5L,6L,7L)

class(aVector)#this detects the type of the value inside of the vector
class(a2Vector)
```
