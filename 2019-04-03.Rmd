## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(readr)
exData2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/exData2.csv")
currency <- exData2$幣別
```


```{r}
head(currency) #head()tells you tje first six data of an object
```


#資料有幾種:把它先轉成factor class，再用levels檢查
```{r}
class(currency)
```

```{r}
currency<-as.factor(currency) #前面是舊資料，後面是新資料
```

```{r}
class(currency)
```

```{r}
levels(currency)
```
#length() calculates the number of elements in a vector
```{r}
length(levels(currency)) #levels() is a vector data, this means there are five kinds of currency saved in the data
```
#how many of the datas are japanese yen?
```{r}
currency=='日圓JPY/USD' #this shows every single one of the data

sum(currency=='日圓JPY/USD') #sum() shows the sum of all the datas that matches the requirements
```
